## ✨ Hi there! ✨

it's my vault for algorithmic problems mainly from Leetcode. 

Repo contains not only solutions but also explanations.

###✨ Topics I got here:
- two pointers approach
- sliding window approach
- different searchers (binary search, depth first search DFS etc.)
- dynamic programming etc.

Let's solve together! My Leetcode account is [here](https://leetcode.com/atmay/) ✨
